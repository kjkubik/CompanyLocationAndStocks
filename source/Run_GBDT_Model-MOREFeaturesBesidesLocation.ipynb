    "*mean_squared_error:* The smaller the mean squared error, the closer you are to finding the line of best fit. Depending on your data, it may be impossible to get a very small value for the mean squared error. For example, the above data is scattered wildly around the regression line, so 6.08 is as good as it gets (and is in fact, the line of best fit). \n",

    "accuracy. In some cases, Adjusted R-squared of 0.4 or more is acceptable as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus RMSE can be very sensitive to outliers; in general we call this form of statistic not \"robust\". \n",
    "Robust statistics is a field interested in algorithms that are NOT sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "Since the errors are squared before they are averaged, the RMSE gives a relatively high weight to large errors. \n",
    "This means the RMSE is most useful when large errors are particularly desirable. Both the MAE and RMSE can range\n",
    "from 0 to ∞. They are negatively-oriented scores: Lower values are better."
