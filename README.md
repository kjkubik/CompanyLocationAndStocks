# CompanyLocationAndStocks

## Overview

### Purpose

#### Topic

We are investing the impacts geographic locations of companies on their stock performances.  

#### Reasoning

There are multiple pockets in the country that are at risk for becoming modern-day ghost towns based on decreases in economic activities.  These cities can benefit from diversifying the types of work available by introducing new businesses from other sectors that are already visibly successful, especially using stock performance as a metric.  As a result of introducing these new businesses, communities will seek to invest in them and boost local economies long-term as opposed to shifting focus to other cities or only setting up short-term plans.  If it isn't necessary for a company to be located in the same general area as other companies that operate similarly, local communites can benefit greatly.

#### Questions to Answer

1) When investigating the performance of companies by their stocks, do geographical locations have a significant impact in comparison to other factors such as the size of the company or revenue?
2) Is it necessary to move the locations of headquarters to cities that have high concentrations of other company headquarters within the same sectors in order to improve stock performance?
3) Is how company crowds buy and sell stocks measurable by geographical location? 
4) Does the geographical location of the home office matter?

### Data Exploration and Analysis

#### Data Exploration

- We collected two years worth of history regarding the top 100 performing stocks in the US Market, ending in March of 2022
- We collected geolocation data of all of the headquarters of each company 
- We collected specific information regarding each of the company regarding their revenues and sizes (number of employees)

#### Description of Preprocessing

We initially had 2 years of quantitative data consisting of open, close, high, low, volume, volume weight and percent change to begin with for the top 100 Nasdaq stocks. The qualitative data consisted of the revenue, employee count and sector. The locational data consisted of city, state, regional and the company’s home office longitudes and latitudes. We used a query to join the data into one table before exporting the data into a comma delimited file. 

In the preprocessing we moved the comma delimited file into a dataframe. From there we used interval controls by capturing the first and last day of an interval, computing the percent change in the volume weight and volume weight and merging the first and last day into a signal dataframe. We then created the categorical data and dropped the columns that were of no use for modeling.

Note: 
- Each individual data set was saved into a CSV file 
- Cleanup was done on each data set to confirm there were no missing values
- The datasets were then imported into Postgres 
- An additional table was created to represent the city/state locations of the companies as regions within the country
- The tables created for each were then joined into a master table to hold all data
- The data was then brought into Jupyter Notebook for additional processing and analysis

### Quantitative Company Data Wrangling
We acquired the qualitative data from a single API found at polygon.io. We captured the data by running Get_Stock_Price.ipynp. There were two years of data we were able to capture and write to a single comma-delimited file. After this we did add a column by computing the percent change from opening and closing prices. Finally, we imported all data into the ticker_daily_stat. 

#### Fields Captured
  - Open
  - Close
  - High
  - Low
  - Volume
  - Volume Weight
  - Number of Transactions
  - Percent Change

### Qualitative Company Data Wrangling
The first thing we did was to capture a listing of the top 100 Nasdaq companies.  This data was readily available in several places out on the web. We did compare sources and make sure we had the most current source of the top 100 companies. After that, it was our belief we needed more qualitative data.  We were able to capture company facts from https://companies-datas.p.rapidapi.com and port the data to a JSON file.  From this source, we used company size and employee number to add to our qualitative data. We also used Wikipedia to capture sector information. All this information was organized and imported into the company_info table. 

#### Fields Captured
- Ticker
- Company URL 
- Revenue
- Employee Count
- Sector  

### Stock’s Data
We were able to capture longitude and latitude company headquarters by using an API at nominatim.openstreetmap.org via coordinate_acqusition_FINAL.ipynb. This data was imported into the table ticker_location along with other fields we manually looked up.
Fields Captured
- Ticker
-	City
- State
-	Country
-	Longitude
-	Latitude

### Map’s Regional Data 
Thankfully we were able to find regional longitude, latitude GeoJSON file from https://eric.clst.org/tech/usgeojson/. This site offered several regional files to download. options. We chose the smallest file present for US States. We had to do some adjusting by adding the REGION field to the file. To be able to use them was a little tricky. We did have to create a repository for all mapping data we created. We downloaded gz_2010_us_040_00_500k.json and added a column in the properties section named REGION. After that we were able to utilize it to create the maps.  

### Daily and Monthly Stock Changes
Both the daily and monthly stock JSON was created using the company_all_star (joined) table. The processes needing to run were json_time_v2 and random_forest_30_day_json_v1. The output files were monthly_json_new3.json and daily_stock_map3.json.  Don’t forget to mention we published our results for the map’s data at https://github.com/kjkubik/ProjectJSONStockInfo

### Machine Learning Model

The two models we used to train the preproced data were Random Forest Models and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees.

### Random Forest Models

### Gradient Boosted Decision Trees
After that we did our preprocessing, we started training our data. The target for our model is the percent change in volume weight. The reason we chose this as our target is because when buying and selling stock, it is more important than the actual price of the stock.  The shape of our training and test data is as follows:
![](images/Shape.png)

To train the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, I used the following settings. 
![](images/GBDT.png)

The results of the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree are as follows: 
![](images/NasdaqPic.png)
The r2 score is expressed as a percentage. The score of 69.74 means that the percentage change of the volume weight prediction is at most 69.74% accurate. However, just because the results are explainable doesn’t mean 69.74% accurate. We only have 69.74% of the picture. 

One of the things that we did notice is that the r2 score was high if we picked dates where it was obvious the stock market in an upward or downward trend. The results below show us that the market is in an upward trend between those dates. It is very possible to get r2 scores as low as 32%. 

![](images/gradientBoostingDT.png)

Because of these inconsistencies, we believe that using more stock metrics would up the scores.  We would have love to add these to our data and if we did have time, we would have. 

- Current Annual Earnings
- Price to Sales Ratio
- Price to Earnings Ratio
- Price to Book Ratio
- Debt to Equity Ratio
- FCF
- PEG ratio
- Operating Expenses
- Capital Expences
- Have Dividends
- Have Share Buybacks
- Earnings Per Share
- Value
- Payout Ratio
- Beta
- Return on Equity
- Compound Annual Growth Rate

We also started a Long Short Term Memory Network model but ran out of time. 

As for the mean absolute error of 4.05. From what we could find, this may mean that on average, the forecast's distance from the true value.  

The mean squared error and root mean squared error are related. That is, the square root of  37.87 is 6.15. It is the arithmetic average of the absolute errors |ei| = |yi – xi|, where yi is the prediction and xi the true value. It kind of tells us how are we are off; but it not exactly meaningful presently. 

#### Intended Training and Testing 	

We are considering training and testing our models primarily on the following features:
- most recent stock performance history
- company geolocations
- size of company (number of employees)
- company revenue

Additional feature types have been considered experimentally to help improve the accuracy of our models.

While we have access to two years worth of data, but in order to not confuse our models with too many features we are considering only using a subset of of this data (maybe certain points in time across the most recent year).

#### Limitations and Benefits of Models

At this time it is difficult to determine fully what our limitations and benefits are to the models we've chosen, as we are working properly with model types for the first time.  With more time and research, we should be able to experiment with our features and learn more about what the model types can really provide for us given our chosen datasets.

Some general notes:

- Random Forest Models are great at providing accurate results because of reducing overfitting and variance, but the more trees that are added to the model the more ineffective and slow it performs for real-time predictions.
- Gradient Boosting as a whole also provides accurate results and is great at handling missing data or data that hasn't been necessarily pre-processed, but is prone to overfitting and placing emphasis outliers.

We've made multiple attempts to work with the different model types we wanted to use for accurate predictions, but ultimately it became apparent that we have not been going in the right direction.  We will need to rework our models to ensure that:

1) Our models are providing results that are accurate
2) The results of our model hold meaning when it comes to answering our questions
